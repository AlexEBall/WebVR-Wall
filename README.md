### VR - Virtual reality

In simple words, Virtutal reality is a new way of viewing content. 
Close your eyes and imagine you at your most favorite place. 
Look in front, turn around and look at the back, what do see?

Eventually, exactly this is VR. 
But instead of you creating the picture from experience and memories, other people create it on the computer for you to experience. 
You can stand in the middle of a famous landscape and turn around, as if you were there. 
You can visit computer created worlds and explore them, whether real or not.
